"""Trace storage layer for trace schema v1 (specs/trace-schema.md, version 1.0.0).

Writes exactly one compact-JSON record per line to date-rotated, append-only
JSONL segment files under the trace root (default ``~/.hermes/sessions/traces/``,
which the spec deliberately places *outside* any profile directory so traces
aggregate across profiles).

Writer API
----------

``append_trace(record, trace_root=None, *, now=None, max_segment_bytes=DEFAULT_SEGMENT_CAP_BYTES) -> Path``
    Serialize ``record`` (a dict conforming to ``specs/trace-v1.schema.json``)
    to a single compact JSON line and append it atomically to the segment for
    the UTC date of ``now``. Opens with ``O_APPEND`` (never truncating flags),
    writes the line, then ``fsync``s before returning. Returns the ``Path`` of
    the segment that received the record. Raises :class:`TraceWriteError` when
    the target exists but is not a regular file, or when ``record`` is not a
    dict / contains non-JSON-serializable values. The trace root is created
    with mode ``0o700`` if missing.

``list_segments(trace_root=None) -> list[Path]``
    Sorted list of ``traces-*.jsonl`` segment paths under the trace root
    (``[]`` when the root does not exist).

``iter_records(path, on_torn=None) -> Iterator[tuple[int, dict]]``
    Yield ``(line_number, record_dict)`` for every parseable non-blank line of
    a segment. A torn or malformed final line — e.g. left behind by a kill -9
    mid-append — is skipped with a ``warnings.warn`` never an exception; all
    prior lines are returned intact. ``on_torn`` (optional callable receiving
    the :class:`TornRecordWarning`) additionally fires for every skipped line,
    torn or not.

``TornRecordWarning`` — warning category carried by both ``warnings.warn``
    and the ``on_torn`` callback: ``.path``, ``.line_no``, ``.raw_preview``.

``SEGMENT_CAP_BYTES`` / ``DEFAULT_SEGMENT_CAP_BYTES`` — the 512 MiB per-segment
    cap the spec fixes.

Rotation
--------

Segments are named ``traces-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` using the UTC date of the write
(the date the run *ends*), per the spec. When appending to the primary segment
would exceed ``max_segment_bytes``, the writer rolls to the next available
suffix — ``traces-YYYY-MM-DD.002.jsonl``, ``.003.jsonl``, … (zero-padded 3
digits). Segment files are created and appended to, never rewritten or
truncated.

Crash semantics
---------------

POSIX guarantees an ``O_APPEND`` positional write of up to ``PIPE_BUF`` bytes
is atomic relative to other appenders, so concurrent processes/threads
interleave at line granularity — one JSON line per record, no interleaved
bytes. Records larger than ``PIPE_BUF`` from multiple processes can still
interleave on some filesystems; that is tolerated by design (the spec's read
side already tolerates torn lines), and the fsync-before-return guarantees a
successfully returned append is durable. A kill -9 mid-append can therefore
only damage the very last line — :func:`iter_records` skips it with a warning
and every earlier line is intact.

Related but separate: the ``request_dump_*.json`` debug breadcrumbs under
``~/.hermes/sessions/`` (agent/agent_runtime_helpers.py) are a different
debug-dump mechanism and are not touched by this module.
